TWICE!
// NOTE: The actual .wpost format used by OpenLive Writer uses Microsoft's Structured Storage
// (COM-based compound document format), which requires additional references and is complex to implement.
// 
// For this demo, we'll create a simplified XML format that mimics the structure
// but saves it with the .wpost extension. A full implementation would require:
// 1. Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word or similar COM references
// 2. Implementation of the full compound document structure with multiple streams
// 3. Proper handling of supporting files (images, etc.)
//
// The real OpenLive Writer format stores data in multiple streams within a compound document:
// - "DestinationBlogId" stream
// - "Id" stream  
// - "Title" stream
// - "Contents" stream (UTF-8 encoded)
// - "SupportingFiles" storage with sub-streams for images/files
// - Various other metadata streams
