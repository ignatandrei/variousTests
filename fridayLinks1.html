<br/>
<br/>Now I'll create a C# console application that can create OpenLive Writer post files. OpenLive Writer posts are typically stored as XML files with metadata and content.
<br/>
<br/>Let me fix that null reference warning:
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>Now let me create a README file to explain how to use the application:
<br/>
<br/>Perfect! I've created a complete C# console application that can create OpenLive Writer posts. Here's what I've built for you:
<br/>
<br/>## Project Structure
<br/>
<br/>1. **
<br/>
<br/>** - Project file targeting .NET 8.0
<br/>2. **
<br/>
<br/>** - Contains the `BlogPost` model and `OpenLiveWriterPostGenerator` class
<br/>3. **
<br/>
<br/>** - Main console application with interactive menu
<br/>4. **
<br/>
<br/>** - Documentation and usage instructions
<br/>
<br/>## Key Features
<br/>
<br/>The application provides:
<br/>
<br/>- **Interactive post creation** - Prompts for title, content, categories, tags, etc.
<br/>- **Load existing posts** - Read and display previously saved XML files
<br/>- **Sample Friday Links generator** - Creates a template weekly links roundup post
<br/>- **OpenLive Writer XML format** - Compatible with the standard format used by OpenLive Writer
<br/>
<br/>## How to Use
<br/>
<br/>1. **Build and run:**
<br/>   ```bash
<br/>   dotnet build
<br/>   dotnet run
<br/>   ```
<br/>
<br/>2. **Menu options:**
<br/>   - Create new posts with full metadata
<br/>   - Load and view existing posts
<br/>   - Generate sample Friday Links posts
<br/>   - Exit the application
<br/>
<br/>The generated XML files follow the OpenLive Writer format with support for:
<br/>- Post metadata (ID, dates, author, blog info)
<br/>- Rich HTML content with CDATA sections
<br/>- Categories and tags
<br/>- Draft/published status
<br/>- Post excerpts
<br/>
<br/>The application handles null safety and file naming automatically, creating sanitized filenames based on post titles and timestamps.</td><td>...</td></tr>

            <h1 title="request_ce269c7c-081f-4dd9-8b37-9216ce7c75c6">Request/Response number 3 </h1>

        <table>
            <thead><tr><th>User</th><th>AI</th><th>Comments</th></thead>

                <tr><td valign="top">The folder where the post must be saved is the drafts folder for open live writer </td><td>I'll modify the application to save posts in the OpenLive Writer drafts folder. OpenLive Writer typically stores drafts in a specific location in the user's profile.
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>Now I need to add the method to get the OpenLive Writer drafts folder:
<br/>
<br/>````
<br/>
<br/>````
<br/>
<br/>Now I'll also update the load existing post functionality to look in the drafts folder by default:
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>Let me also update the README to reflect the new drafts folder functionality:
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>````
<br/>
<br/>````
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>```
<br/>
<br/>Perfect! I've updated the C# console application to properly integrate with OpenLive Writer by:
<br/>
<br/>## Key Changes Made:
<br/>
<br/>1. **Added `GetOpenLiveWriterDraftsFolder()` method** that:
<br/>   - Checks common OpenLive Writer drafts folder locations
<br/>   - Creates the default folder if none exist
<br/>   - Returns the appropriate path for saving posts
<br/>
<br/>2. **Updated post saving** to use the OpenLive Writer drafts folder instead of the current directory
<br/>
<br/>3. **Enhanced the load functionality** to:
<br/>   - Show available XML files in the drafts folder
<br/>   - Allow selection from a numbered list
<br/>   - Fall back to custom path entry if needed
<br/>
<br/>4. **Updated documentation** to explain the OpenLive Writer integration
<br/>
<br/>## OpenLive Writer Drafts Folder Locations:
<br/>
<br/>The application checks these locations in order:
<br/>1. `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Weblog Posts\Drafts`
<br/>2. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenLiveWriter\Drafts`
<br/>3. `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Weblog Posts\Drafts`
<br/>4. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Open Live Writer\Drafts`
<br/>
<br/>If none exist, it creates the standard location at `Documents\My Weblog Posts\Drafts`.
<br/>
<br/>Now when you create posts with this application, they'll be saved directly to the OpenLive Writer drafts folder, making them immediately available when you open OpenLive Writer. The posts will appear in your drafts list and can be edited, published, or managed through the OpenLive Writer interface.</td><td>...</td></tr>
