This is about how I wanted to clean a C# solution of warnings.  The solution had a lot of warnings, and I wanted to remove them.  
<br />
I started with a simple prompt to remove all warnings, but that didn't work. <br /> The number of iterations were : 17
<br />
For the ones in a hurry ,this is the first and the last prompt
