Task: Fix platform-specific API warning CA1416
Warning File: warnings.txt
Warning ID: CA1416
Description: This call site is reachable on all platforms but API is only supported on specific platforms
Solution Instructions:
1. Add platform guards: if (OperatingSystem.IsWindows()) { /* Windows-specific code */ }
2. Use [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")] attribute on methods
3. Add conditional compilation: #if WINDOWS
4. Consider alternative cross-platform implementations
5. Document platform requirements clearly
Verification Instructions:
1. Clean the solution: dotnet clean
2. Build the solution: dotnet build > new_warnings.txt 2>&1
3. Search new_warnings.txt for "CA1416" to confirm warnings are resolved
4. Test on different platforms if possible

Task: Resolve possible null reference argument warning CS8604.

Context: Review the complete build output in warnings.txt for context.

Warning Details:
- Warning ID: CS8604
- File: submodules\farm.configuration.core\Farm.Configuration.Core\Server\ConfigurationJSONCompiler.cs
- Line: 70, Column: 31
- Issue: Potentially null argument passed to non-nullable parameter

Resolution Steps:
1. Add null check before passing the argument
2. Use null-conditional operator (?.) if appropriate
3. Provide a default non-null value
4. Update method signature to accept nullable parameter if null is valid

Verification:
1. Clean the solution: dotnet clean FarmOrchestrator.sln
2. Rebuild: dotnet build FarmOrchestrator.sln > warnings_new.txt 2>&1
3. Verify CS8604 warning at line 70 is resolved in warnings_new.txt
4. Test the method with various inputs to ensure no null reference exceptions

Task: Resolve unreachable code warning CS0162.

Context: Review the complete build output in warnings.txt for context.

Warning Details:
- Warning ID: CS0162
- File: UsefulExtensions\src\UsefulExtensions\UsefulExtensions\ActionExtensions.cs
- Line: 19, Column: 55
- Issue: Code that can never be executed

Resolution Steps:
1. Examine the control flow to identify why code is unreachable
2. Remove the unreachable code if it's truly unnecessary
3. Fix the logic that prevents the code from being reached
4. Add conditional compilation directives if code is for specific builds

Verification:
1. Clean the solution: dotnet clean FarmOrchestrator.sln
2. Rebuild: dotnet build FarmOrchestrator.sln > warnings_new.txt 2>&1
3. Verify CS0162 warning at line 19 is resolved in warnings_new.txt
4. Test the method functionality to ensure expected behavior
